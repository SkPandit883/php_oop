when we want to save object in file or session ,first of all we need 
to convert it into array by using serialize function as :
 serialize($obj)
 this method convert all properties of the class into array

 if we need to store only some properties of the class into session or file .
 we need to serialize only that properties of the class into array.

 so there is a concept of sleep magic method ,which is called automatically when
 object is going to be serialized. 


 syntax:
 public function __sleep(){
     return array('properties_name');
 }
